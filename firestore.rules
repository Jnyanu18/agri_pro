/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the AgriFarm AI application.
 * All user-created data (plants, feedback) is secured to ensure only the owning user can read, update, or delete it.
 * Data structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /plants/{plantId}: Plant data, accessible only to the owner (via uid field).
 * - /feedback/{feedbackId}: Farmer feedback, accessible only to the owner (via uid field).
 * - /market/{district}/{date}: Market prices, publicly readable but only writable by backend functions.
 * - /metrics/{yyyymmdd}: Daily metrics, writable only by backend functions, not readable by clients.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Market data is public read-only (written by Cloud Functions).
 * - Daily metrics are write-only by Cloud Functions (not readable by clients).
 * - Ownership is validated by checking the 'uid' field within documents against request.auth.uid.
 * - All destructive operations (update, delete) require the document to exist.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'plants' and 'feedback' documents contain a 'uid' field that stores the owner's user ID.
 *   This avoids the need for costly `get()` calls to the `/users/{userId}` document to check ownership.
